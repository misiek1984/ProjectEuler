# ProjectEuler
My solutions of some of ProjectEuler tasks

This project contains references to projects that can be found in my other repository. 
See [Common](https://github.com/misiek1984/Common) for details.
If you want to compile *ProjectEuler* locally, you also need to download *Common* repository.
Both repositories should be placed in the same directory.
